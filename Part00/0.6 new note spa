title New note (SPA)

note left of browser: 
When the button on the form is clicked, together with the HTTP POST, 
the browser will send the user input to the server
(it will be sent as JSON-data containing both the content
of the note (content) and the timestamp (date)).
end note

browser->server: HTTP POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
server-->browser: HTTP status code 201 (created - the request has been fulfilled)

note right of server:
JavaScript code (the push() method) is used instead of sending
the form data in the traditional way (meaning that the server
won't not ask for a redirect).
end note

server->browser: HTTP POST ... notes sent as JSON-string
